Hi, I’m Adrian Platte. I've been working at Novation since 2018 as a software developer. I mainly use C# and SQL Server for maintaining the rich client Front-End of Novation's CTTV system. I've also been working with Qt for rebuilding another Front-End video application from a Windows plattform to ARM. I've also done web development using jQuery combined with C# API REST backend.
